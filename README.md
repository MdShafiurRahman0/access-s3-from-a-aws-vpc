5. For IPv6 CIDR block, we'll leave in the default option of No IPv6 CIDR block.

6. For Tenancy, we'll keep the selection of Default.

7. For Number of Availability Zones (AZs), we'll use just 1 Availability Zone.

8. Make sure the Number of public subnets chosen is 1.

9. For Number of private subnets, we'll keep thing simple today and go with 0 private subnets.

10. For the NAT gateways ($) option, make sure you've selected None. As the dollar sign suggests, NAT gateways cost money!

11. For the VPC endpoints option, select None.
