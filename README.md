# Step 1: Set up  VPC and EC2 Instance

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/670de0fd-f323-4a95-8ad8-67caba244922)



1. Select Create VPC.

2. Select VPC and more.

3. Under Name tag auto-generation, enter

4. The VPC's IPv4 CIDR block is already pre-filled to 10.0.0.0/16 - we'll use this default CIDR block!


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1891a253-59c6-41db-9fba-e8b4e7342cc7)


5. For IPv6 CIDR block, we'll leave in the default option of No IPv6 CIDR block.

6. For Tenancy, we'll keep the selection of Default.

7. For Number of Availability Zones (AZs), we'll use just 1 Availability Zone.

8. Make sure the Number of public subnets chosen is 1.

9. For Number of private subnets, we'll keep thing simple today and go with 0 private subnets.

10. For the NAT gateways ($) option, make sure you've selected None. As the dollar sign suggests, NAT gateways cost money!

11. For the VPC endpoints option, select None.

# Step 2:  Launch an instance in your VPC



1. Head to the EC2 console - search for in the search bar at the top of screen.

2. Select Instances at the left hand navigation bar.

3. Select Launch instances.

4. Since your first EC2 instance will be launched in your first VPC, let's name it 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c55fb036-56a0-4663-b67a-59ae0c83524a)


For the Amazon Machine Image, select Amazon Linux 2023 AMI.
For the Instance type, select t2.micro.
For the Key pair (login) panel, select  Proceed without a key pair (not recommended).
At the Network settings panel, select Edit at the right hand corner.
Under VPC, select NextWork-vpc.
Under Subnet, select your VPC's public subnet.
Keep the Auto-assign public IP setting to... do you remember whether our EC2 instance needs a public IP address?
üí° Hmmm, I can't seem to remember. What is it?
We're using EC2 Instance Connect after this to connect with our EC2 instance!

EC2 Instance Connect requires instances to be in a public subnet AND have a public IPv4 address!


üí° What is EC2 Instance Connect?
EC2 Instance Connect is an EC2 tool designed to help you get direct access to your EC2 instance!

Once you get direct access to your EC2 instance, you're going into the instance's terminal. This lets you do some advanced work like installing software into your EC2 instance or accessing another AWS service!

Select Enable.
Step 1: Your instance's network settings.
Step 1: Your instance's network settings.

For the Firewall (security groups) setting, choose Create security group.
‚è∏Ô∏è PAUSE
Before you read ahead - can you figure out the correct security group settings for this EC2 instance?

Hint: you WON'T need to run ping tests in this project!

Hmmm!
ü§î
ü§î
ü§î

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Alright - steps below!

Name your security group 
That's it! No security group rules to add.
üí° Didn't we use to add other security group rules?
By default, this new security group allows all inbound SSH traffic. That's all we need to use EC2 Instance Connect later.

We used to add an inbound rule to allow ICMP traffic - but we won't need it if we aren't running any ping tests!

Step 1: Your new security group settings.
Step 1: Your new security group settings.

Select Launch instance.

üíª Step #2
Connect to Your EC2 Instance

In this step, we're gonna connect to your EC2 instance and try access an AWS service!



In this step, you're going to:

Connect directly to your EC2 instance.

Head to your EC2 console and the Instances page.
Select the checkbox next to Instance - NextWork VPC Project.
Select Connect.
In the EC2 Instance Connect set up page, select Connect again.
Yay! Successfully connected.
Step 2: Feels good that we've connected right away!
Step 2: Feels good that we've connected right away!

For your first command, try running 
, which is a command used to list the S3 buckets in your account (yup, ls stands for list!).
üí° Wait, you can view S3 buckets from an instance's terminal?!
Yes, you can! From an EC2 instance's terminal, you can run all kinds of commands to interact with AWS services. Listing all the S3 buckets you have access to is just the tip of the iceberg!


üí° How does that work?
There is a special software called the AWS CLI (Command Line Interface) that you install and run on your computer to control AWS services directly from the command line i.e. your terminal! You can install this in your local computer too, and all EC2 instances come with it already installed.


Extra for Experts: As you advance in your cloud engineering career, you'll find that the AWS CLI often becomes your go-to tool. Engineers use the CLI to automate tasks and manage AWS resources efficiently using scripts, making it essential for managing your cloud environment in an efficient way.

While the AWS Management Console is fantastic for learning and having a visual guide, the CLI provides the speed and versatility that professionals need for complex tasks.

Step 2: Run `aws s3 ls`
Step 2: Run `aws s3 ls`

Hmmm, doesn't look like a success. We need to provide credentials.
üí° What are credentials?
Credentials in AWS are like keys that let you access and manage AWS services securely. Without credentials, you won't have the permission to do things like viewing your S3 bucket list.


üí° Do I have credentials?
When you log into your AWS Management Console, you're already authenticated using your AWS user's details.

Running commands from an EC2 instance is a different story! You can think of your EC2 instance as another user that needs its own username and password (i.e. credentials) to get access to your AWS account.

Your account by default doesn't have credentials set up for running commands from an EC2 instance. You'll need to manually set these up to securely access and manage AWS services from your instance.

Run 
The terminal is now asking us for an Access Key ID!
Step 2: Run `aws configure`
Step 2: Run `aws configure`

üí° What is an access key ID? Do I have one?
An access key ID is a part of a credential!

Your credentials are made up of a username and password; think of the access key ID as the username.

You don't automatically have one, but you can create access keys IDs through AWS IAM.


üí° What's the difference between access keys and key pairs?
You might remember key pairs from launching EC2 instances!

Key pairs are used specifically for logging into your EC2 instances through SSH.

Access keys, which are what we're learning about now, are credentials for your applications and other servers to log into AWS and talk to your AWS services/resources.

üîë Step #3
Create Access Keys

Challenge accepted! Your EC2 instance needs credentials to access your AWS services, so let's set up access keys right away üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è



In this step, you're going to:

Give your EC2 instance access to your AWS environment.
Step 3: Create access keys.

üí° What is the yellow warning banner saying?
In this project we're creating access keys and manually applying them in our EC2 instance, but typically the recommended way is to create an IAM role with the necessary permissions and then attaching that role to your EC2 instance.

Your EC2 instance would inherit the permissions from the role, and this is best practise as you can easily attach and detach EC2 instances from roles to give and take away their credentials.

We aren't using this method so that we can learn about access keys, but roles are usually a better alternative for security.


üí° Extra for Experts: What do the other options mean?
Let's break 'em down!

Choose Local code if you're building an application in your local computer, and need the access key to connect your app with AWS services.
Choose Application running on an AWS compute service if you're building an application that's running on an AWS compute service like EC2 or Lambda, and need the access key to connect your app with AWS services.
Choose Third-party service if you're running an application from an external company (i.e. it wasn't built by yourself or AWS), but requires access to your AWS environment. For example, Crowdstrike is a third party security service that requires access to your AWS environment to protect them in real time!
Choose Application running outside AWS if you're running an application built by yourself but hosted on a physical server or another cloud platform, and you need to integrate it with AWS services.
Select Next.
For the Description tag value, we'll write 
Step 3: Give your access key a description.
Step 3: Give your access key a description.

Select Create access key.
OOoo this is important! STAY ON THIS PAGE ‚úã
Step 3: Stay on this page!
Step 3: Stay on this page!

You've just created your access key, well done.

This is the only time that your secret access key can be viewed or downloaded. You cannot recover it later. However, you can create a new access key any time.

üí° What is the secret access key?
The secret access key is like the password that pairs with your access key ID (your username). You need both to access AWS services.

Secret is a key word here - anyone who has it can access your AWS account, so we need to keep this away from anyone else!

Select Download .csv file near the bottom of the page.
üö® PLEASE don't forget to delete your access key and the .csv file at the END of your session!

If you don't finish this project today, it's better to delete your access key and create a new one tomorrow, than to keep the same access key for a longer period of time.

‚úçÔ∏è What is a secret access key?
Start your response with 'Secret access keys are'...

Did you know you could upload files using AWS CLI too?!

Run 
 to create a blank .txt file in your EC2 instance.
üí° What does this command say?
Let's break it down!

sudo stands for "superuser do" and it's used when you're running a command that typicaly needs elevated user permissions, like installing software or creating new files.

touch is a standard command used to create an empty file if it doesn't exist. If it does exist, this command will update the file's timestamp (i.e. the last time it was accessed) instead.

/tmp/ is a common directory path (you can think of a directory path as layers and layers of folders) typically used for temporary files.

test.txt is the name of the empty file you're creating!

Next, run 
 to upload that file into your bucket.
üí° What does this command say?
Let's break it down!

aws s3 c: is the command to copy files.

/tmp/test.txt is the source file path. It's saying that the file to copy is test.txt, which exists inside a folder called tmp.

s3://nextwork-vpc-project-yourname is the destination path. It's saying that the file should be copied to the S3 bucket vpc-project-yourname!

Finally, run 
 again - what objects are listed in your bucket now?
Step 5: Run `aws s3 ls s3://nextwork-vpc-project-yourname` again.
Step 5: Run `aws s3 ls s3://nextwork-vpc-project-yourname` again.

üí° What is the 0 next to test.txt?
The numbers next to each file name is the size fo that file! Since test.txt is an empty file with no data, it has 0 bytes.

Your amazing work today!
Your amazing work today!

Today you've learnt how to:

üîë Set up access keys for an EC2 instance: You created an access key for your EC2 instance. Now your EC2 instance can interact with your AWS services e.g. view objects in your S3 bucket!


üë©‚Äçüíª Interact with S3 through the AWS CLI: You learnt what AWS ClI does, and you ran commands to see a list of buckets and even upload an object to a bucket!



üëÄ A teaser for your next project...

Wooooohoo! Your EC2 instance definitely has access to your bucket - your access key worked üëè

Buttt your EC2 instance is accessing your bucket through the public internet.

This isn't the most secure way to communicate - external threats and attacks can easily intercept traffic and get access to your AWS environment or sensitive data.

What's a VPC resource that could solve this?
